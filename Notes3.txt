RESTful API testing

(i) negative testing on APIs

(a) http method tampering
(b) payload tampering
(c) query parameter tampering
(d) end point tampering
(e) request headers tampering
(f) protocol downgrade test [http instead of https]

test execution is ran from TEST STEP, TEST CASE, TEST SUITE

report is also generated

======================================

(ii) end to end testing scenario
(iii) loop continuously
(iv) delay
(v) set time-out


GET https://reqres.in/api/users/2

valid id: 1 to 12
invalid id : <1 , >12

Bug#1: Method tampering is exposed ; the LIST USERS API is not rejected by the server with 405 response code, when the method used is unsupported at the server side

Bug#2: payload tampering is exposed ; server side validations are failing at the API level for CREATE USER, UPDATE USER

Bug#3: query parameter tampering is exposed ; server side validations are failing at the API level for LIST USERS API ; page#1 data is retrieved by the server when the query is to retrieve page#0 which is data security breach


CREATE USER: POST https://reqres.in/api/users

{
    "name": "morpheus",
    "job": "leader"
}

================

GET http://thetestingworldapi.com/api/studentsDetails


POST http://thetestingworldapi.com/api/studentsDetails

PUT api/studentsDetails/935121

DELETE api/studentsDetails/935121

935121 is Kiran id

================

REST APIs

(i) reqres.in
(ii) testingworldapi.com

Negative test scenarios
execute at test step level, test case level, test suite level,
generate all formats of test reports
add assertions

Property Transfer
API chaining
Delay
generate complete report
